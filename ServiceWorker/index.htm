        There are fundamental differences in their lifecycle and the number of instances per origin you can have. In short:

        |              | Web Workers  | Service Workers  |
        |--------------|--------------|------------------|
        | Instances    | Many per tab | One for all tabs |
        | Lifespan     | Same as tab  | Independent      |
        | Intended use | Parallelism  | Offline support  |
